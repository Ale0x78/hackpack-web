# üåê Web Challenges

Web challenges are generally are vulnerable websites or internet-agencent systems. Attacks that appear often are [Cross Site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) and [SQL Injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) attacks, to name a few. Often, the goal in a web challenge is login as admin or stealing an admin's session cookie.

Web challenges are a good place to start if you've never done a CTF, as they require less setup and most people know some of the basics of the web and websites work.

## Must-Have Tools
### [Browser Devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/#discover)
You already have this installed! Press `F12` in your browser, and you're half-way to becoming a `l33t h4x0r`. 

The most important tabs are:
- [Elements](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/#elements) - View and change the DOM and CSS.
- [Console](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/#console) - View messages and run JavaScript from the Console.
- [Network](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/#network) - View and debug network activity.
- [Application](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/#application) - Primarily useful for viewing the current page's cookies

The rest are generally not relevent to solving web challenges.

### [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload)
Burp allows you to intercept and edit requests coming from and going to your browser. 

Burp has a rich suite of tools and extentions, but the tool with the most immediate relevency is the **Proxy** tab. Using Burp's internal browser (or your browser, although this requires  a bit of setup)

When you open the browswer with the `Intercept is on` button enabled, you'll notice that your browswer pauses while loading and an HTTP request shows up in the Burp window:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.125 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close
```

This is the request the browser is trying to make. Hit the `Forward` button or turn the Intercept off and the browser will continue as normal.

This functionality allows you to bypass interacting with the UI of a website and send data directly to the server. For example, say you're testing a login page that doesn't allow certain characters. Using Burp you could make a dummy request, intercept it, and add the illegal characters to send to the server

```http
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Connection: close
Content-Length: 73
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.125 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Origin: www.example.com
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors
Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9

email=admin@example.com &password=%27AND 1=1;-- SQL injection, anyone?
```
