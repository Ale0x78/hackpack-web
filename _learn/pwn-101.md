# ðŸ’€ Binary Exploitation (Pwn)

Binary Exploitation (pwn) challenges involve finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a program, typically to gain a remote shell. Pwn challenges tend to have a higher learning curve than the other categories. A familiar understanding of Linux, C, assembly, are recommended before doing pwn challenges.

The _classic_ pwn challenge is the Stash Smash attack, originally outlined in [this forum post](http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html)

Computerphile has a great video about stack smash attacks here:

## Learning Resources
- Learn Assembly and C
  - [Comparing C to Machine Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOyaJXpAYZQ)
- Learn about the stack and calling conventions
- [LiveOverflow's Binary Exploitation Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN) - This playlist is an incredible resource for learning binary exploitation, and will walk you through nearly all techniques used in entry-mid level pwn challenges

## Practice
- [OverTheWire - Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) - For getting familiar with Linux commands
- [OverTheWire - Narnia](https://overthewire.org/wargames/narnia/) - For practicing basic binary exploitation
- [Exploit Eductation - Phoenix](https://exploit.education/phoenix/) - Introduces exploits of increasing difficulty
- [Pico Gym](https://play.picoctf.org/practice?category=6&page=1) - Archives challenges from past PicoCTF competitions and has great beginner binary exploitation challenges

## Must-Have Tools
- [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) - for light reverse engineering to find vulnerability
- [GDB](http://www.unknownroad.com/rtfm/gdbtut/gdbtoc.html) - for tracing how the program handles your input
- [Pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) - A Python library for Pwn solution scripts. Useful for sending/receiving input, reading memory, and more.
