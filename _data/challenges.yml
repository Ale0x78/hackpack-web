      Decode these two keys from Base64 and XOR them keys to get the flag! <br> <br>
      Be sure to do this as part of a script; you will need that code for the next two challenges.

  title: XOR Crypto - Easy-ish
  about: |
      This ciphertext has been XOR encrypted with a single length key. <br> <br>
      For example, if the key was <code>f</code>, each byte of the plaintext would be XORed with <code>f</code>. <br> <br>
      The cipher text is also in Base64, which you'll need to decode before XORing

  title: XOR Crypto - Medium
  about: |
      This ciphertext has been XOR encrypted with a variable length key. <br> <br>
      For instance, if the key was <code>wot</code>, the first byte of the plaintext would be XORed with <code>w</code>, the second with <code>o</code>, the third with <code>t</code>, and then it would loop around to XOR the fourth character with <code>w</code> <br> <br>
      The cipher text is also in Base64, which you'll need to decode before XORing
