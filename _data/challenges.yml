  title: xor_crypto2
  about: "This ciphertext has been XOR encrypted with a single length key. 
  For example, if the key was 'f', each byte of the plaintext would be XORed with 'f'. 
  Submit the key in the following format: hackpack{KEY}"

  title: xor_crypto3
  about: "This ciphertext has been XOR encrypted with a variable length key. 
  For instance, if the key was 'wot', the first byte of the plaintext would be XORed with 'w', the second with 'o', the third with 't', and then it would loop back XOR the fourth character with 'w'
