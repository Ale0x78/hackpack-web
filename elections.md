# HackPack Spring 2021 Election Packet

## Voting
<hr>

We have two officer roles opening up, the **President** and **Secretary** role. Voting will open up **November 19th** and continue until **November 26th**.  

Voting will take place online through [GetInvolved](https://getinvolved.ncsu.edu/organization/hackpack)


### Eligibility

Only **active** members currently enrolled in classes at NCSU will be eligible to vote. To be considered active, a member must have come to **3 or more meetings** throughout the semester. 

Meeting attendance determined through looking at the Friday meeting check-in form. If members forgot to sign in via the check-in form anytime during the semester, then they can reach out to Dominic Brown (@NaPKiN) if they need to appeal.

As it wasn’t clear during the semester that the check-in forms would be used this way, the review process will be fairly generous.

Voting will take place through [GetInvolved](https://getinvolved.ncsu.edu/organization/hackpack). As such, active members will be added to member roster on the website. If you do not see your name on the GetInvolved roster, contact Dominic Brown (@NaPKiN) on Discord.

### Casting Votes

The voting process, as [outlined in the constitution](https://getinvolved.ncsu.edu/organization/hackpack/documents/view/1952719) is as follows:

> A members-only meeting should be held in the last 60 days of each Spring semester so that voting of
next year’s officers can take place. Prior to this meeting, the candidates for each officer position shall
apply electronically for the position. 

Digital voting will open up during the meeting on **November 19th** and continue until **November 26th**. Non-members will be permitted to attend this meeting, but only active members will be permitted to vote. 

> During this meeting, each member interested in running for an 
officer position should be given time to introduce themselves to the members and explain why they
would be the best candidate for the job

Candidates will be given a short period to speak during the election meeting. Additionally, candidates will be required to provide a short, written proposal outlining their plans for the club if elected. See `Running` section below

> Voting shall take place in rounds starting with the President
position and work down the officer hierarchy listed in Article V. For an officer to officially be elected,
the officer with the most votes will be elected to the position. If a candidate is not elected for a
position, they should be given the opportunity to run for the next level down in the officer hierarchy

The officer hierarchy is as follows:

1. President
1. Vice President
1. Treasurer
1. Secretary

In the case a position is filled by a member who is already an officer, the position they're vacating will be immediately available for reelection. For instance, if the current Vice President is elected as the new President, all applicable candidates may compete for the Vice President role

Officer details and duties can be found in the [constitution]((https://getinvolved.ncsu.edu/organization/hackpack/documents/view/1952719)) in `Article V`

> If a candidate is running unopposed at the time of voting for that position,then they shall be elected to that position by default

> Current officers should not be allowed to vote in this process, unless a tie
should occur, in which case the out-going officer should choose their successor. New officers will begin holding the position for which they were elected after the Spring semester final exams.

We will be amending this with the following addendum:

> Current officers should not be allowed to vote in this process, **unless they are running. In which case, an officer running for reelection or election in a new position will be permitted to vote for themselves and no one else**. In the case of a tie, the out-going officer should choose their successor. 


## Running
<hr>

Candidates are assumed to be running for all positions, unless otherwise specified. This includes positions that are not necessarily up for reelection. This is because if an open role is filled by a member who is already serving as an officer, their position will immediately open for reelection.

Additionally, if a candidate already holds an officer position, it is also assumed that they are not running for a position lower on the officer hierarchy than the one they currently occupy. 

### Eligibility

Any **active** member is also eligible to run for office. See the voting eligibility section for more detail

### Running

Write a short paragraph on your goals for the upcoming Spring 2022 semester. Consider answering some or all of the following questions:
- How would you improve outreach to new members?
- How would you increase member retention?
- Over the next year, how can we better "onboard" less experienced members?
- Do you have any other goals for the club not covered by the above questions?

These will be published for voting members to review before casting their votes, as such, please have these written and sent to Dominic Brown by **November 17th**

Additionally, candidates will have 2-3 minutes to give a brief summary of their goals for the club during club time on **November 19th**.
