# HackPack Spring 2021 Election Packet
## Voting
<hr>

### Eligibility

Only **active** members will be eligible to vote. To be considered active, a member must have come to **3 or more meetings** throughout the semester. 

Meeting attendance determined through looking at the Friday meeting check-in form. If members forgot to sign in via the check-in form anytime during the semester, then they can reach out to Dominic Brown (@NaPKiN) if they need to appeal. As it wasn’t clear during the semester that the check-in forms would be used this way, I’ll be pretty generous.

### Casting Votes

The voting process, as [outlined in the constitution](https://getinvolved.ncsu.edu/organization/hackpack/documents/view/1952719) is as follows:

> A members-only meeting should be held in the last 60 days of each Spring semester so that voting of
next year’s officers can take place. Prior to this meeting, the candidates for each officer position shall
apply electronically for the position. 

Non-members will be permitted to attend, but only active members will be permitted to vote

> During this meeting, each member interested in running for an 
officer position should be given time to introduce themselves to the members and explain why they
would be the best candidate for the job

Canidates will be givin a short period to speak during the election meeting. Additionally, canidates will be required to provide a short, written proposal outlining their plans for the club if elected. (More details to follow)

> Voting shall take place in rounds starting with the President
position and work down the officer hierarchy listed in Article V. For an officer to officially be elected,
the officer with the most votes will be elected to the position. If a candidate is not elected for a
position, they should be given the opportunity to run for the next level down in the officer hierarchy

Officer details can be found in the constitution in `Article V`

> If a candidate is running unopposed at the time of voting for that position,then they shall be elected to that position by default

> Current officers should not be allowed to vote in this process, unless a tie
should occur, in which case the out-going officer should choose their successor. New officers will begin holding the position for which they were elected after the Spring semester final exams.

We will be amending this with the following addendum:

> Current officers should not be allowed to vote in this process, unless they are running. In which case, an officer running for reelction or election in a new position will be permitted to vote for themselves and no one else. In the case of a tie, the out-going officer should choose their successor.
