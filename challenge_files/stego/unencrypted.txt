Admittedly, that first challenge was a lot more steganography than crypto. Was it fun, though?
Excited for the next one? Steganography is cool, but there's at least a little bit of normal crypto
in this one, I promise. Oh, you might want to be familiar with poly-alphabetic ciphers for this.
My MA 437 class recently learned how to break some classic ciphers, including this one. Ever heard
of an index of coincidence? It can be used to identify whether a ciphertext is encoded in a mono-
alphabetic or a poly-alphabetic cipher. Don't overthink this challenge, now, but heed my words.
Everything can be hidden in plain sight. Anyway, good luck cracking this one!
