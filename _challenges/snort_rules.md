title: Writing Snort IDS rules 
---
This challenge is centered around analyzing pcaps from 
malware running in a virtual machine and writing rules
to detect the malicious traffic via Snort, a network
intrusion detection system (IDS). </br>

The talk on 4/9/2021
will discuss how to use Wireshark to inspect PCAPs and
provide an overiew of how to write Snort rules, but the
ultimate goal of this challenge is for anyone interested
to be able to write a Snort rule that detects real
malware and then have the Snort rule added into the 
official Snort community ruleset.<br><br>
